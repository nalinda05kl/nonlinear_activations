### nonlinear_activations
Empirical study of the effects of nonlinearity in activation functions on the performance of deep learning models

### This repository consists of following codes:
 - **performance_vs_alpha**: The accuracy and loss calculated for different model architecturs using the MNIST data set.
 - **performance_vs_data_domain**: The accuracy and loss calculated based on different data domains.
